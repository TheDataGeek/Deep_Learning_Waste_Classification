Deep Machine Learning | Project ProposalQuestion/Need:1. Despite our recycling efforts, many of our recyclables still end up in our landfills or oceans. Can deep machine learning be used to identify and sort household garbage into recycling categories, to improve current recycling model logistics?2. Environmental services and waste management industries, such as Republic Services and Waste Management, would potentially benefit from this projectData Description:1. Kaggle.com Ð Garbage Classification (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafaabla/garbage-classification)2. Units of analysis include images of various types of trash found in the datasetTools (Algorithms):1. Python neural network libraries including TensorFlow and Keras2. Additional tools potentially include AWS and OpenCVMVP Goal:1. Data acquisition and training/fitting a model to correctly identify and classify recyclables
